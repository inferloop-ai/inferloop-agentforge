# Inferloop Testing Policy
## MANDATORY FOR ALL REPOSITORIES

**Effective Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Policy Version**: 1.0  
**Enforcement**: MANDATORY - No exceptions

---

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

**EVERY CHANGE, NO MATTER HOW SMALL, MUST HAVE ASSOCIATED TESTS**

This policy applies to:
- All Inferloop repositories
- All code changes (features, fixes, refactoring)
- All configuration changes
- All documentation that includes code examples

---

## Core Testing Principles

### 1. Zero Regression Tolerance
- **NO** functionality should break with new changes
- **NO** existing tests should fail after changes
- **NO** deployment without passing all tests

### 2. Test-First Development
Before implementing any change:
1. Write tests that define expected behavior
2. Ensure tests fail initially (red)
3. Implement the change
4. Ensure tests pass (green)
5. Refactor if needed (maintain green)

### 3. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% for all new code
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100% for:
  - Authentication/Authorization
  - Payment processing
  - Data generation
  - API endpoints
  - Security features

## Test Implementation Checklist

For EVERY change, ensure:

### Before Starting
- [ ] Identify affected components
- [ ] Review existing tests
- [ ] Plan new test cases
- [ ] Set up test data

### During Development
- [ ] Write unit tests first
- [ ] Implement feature/fix
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Update documentation

### Before Committing
- [ ] Run all test suites
- [ ] Check test coverage
- [ ] Fix any failing tests
- [ ] Review test output

### Before Merging
- [ ] Pass CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Peer review tests
- [ ] Verify no regressions
- [ ] Update test documentation

---

## Regression Testing Protocol

### Daily Regression Suite
Run automatically at 2 AM UTC:
```bash
./scripts/run-regression-tests.sh
```

### Pre-Release Testing
Before any release:
1. Full regression test suite
2. Cross-browser testing
3. Load testing
4. Security scanning
5. Manual smoke tests

### Post-Deployment Verification
After deployment:
1. Health check endpoints
2. Critical path validation
3. Performance monitoring
4. Error rate monitoring

---

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Requirements
- Use synthetic data only
- No production data in tests
- Deterministic test data
- Isolated test environments

### DataMint Integration
Use DataMint for generating test data:
```python
from datamint import generate_test_data

test_data = generate_test_data(
    schema="customer",
    rows=100,
    method="faker"
)
```

---

## Continuous Integration Requirements

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          npm test
          npm run test:coverage
      - name: Check Coverage
        run: |
          if [ $(npm run coverage:check) -lt 80 ]; then
            echo "Coverage below 80%"
            exit 1
          fi
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: run-tests
        name: Run Tests
        entry: npm test
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
```

---

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Test Failure Alerts
- Immediate Slack notification
- Email to development team
- Block deployments
- Create incident ticket

### Coverage Monitoring
- Daily coverage reports
- Trend analysis
- Alert on coverage drop
- Monthly coverage review

---

## Enforcement

### Automated Enforcement
- Pre-commit hooks block commits without tests
- CI/CD pipeline fails without 80% coverage
- Deployments blocked if tests fail
- Automated rollback on test failures

### Manual Review
- Code reviews must verify test presence
- Test quality assessment
- Coverage verification
- Regression test confirmation

---

## Test Documentation

### Required Documentation
For each test:
- Purpose and scope
- Test data requirements
- Expected outcomes
- Edge cases covered
- Performance expectations

### Test Naming Convention
```javascript
// Good test names
test('should generate 100 rows of customer data using faker method')
test('should return 404 when agent ID does not exist')
test('should validate email format in user registration')

// Bad test names
test('test1')
test('works')
test('data generation')
```

---
