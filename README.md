# InferLoop AgentForge

## Overview

InferLoop AgentForge is a framework setup and environment preparation tool that serves as the foundation layer for the InferLoop AI Agent Development Ecosystem. It focuses on framework selection, environment configuration, and boilerplate generation to accelerate agent development.

## Purpose

AgentForge handles the foundation layer of agent development:
- **Framework Selection**: Benchmark-driven recommendations for choosing the right AI framework
- **Environment Setup**: Automated development environment creation and configuration
- **Boilerplate Generation**: Framework-specific scaffolding and project templates
- **Dependency Management**: Smart package resolution and compatibility checking

## Relationship to AgentCraft

AgentForge works in tandem with AgentCraft:
- **AgentForge**: Prepares the development environment and generates initial code structure
- **AgentCraft**: Provides visual development tools and production deployment capabilities
- **Data Flow**: AgentForge output feeds directly into AgentCraft for further development

## Key Modules

### BUILDER Module (AgentForge Focus)
- Framework setup and configuration
- Dependency installation and management
- Environment variable configuration
- Boilerplate code generation

### TESTER Module (Framework Testing)
- Framework validation and smoke tests
- Dependency verification
- Environment health checks
- Performance benchmarking

### DEPLOYER Module (Development Environment)
- Local development setup
- Docker compose configuration
- Development containers
- Build script generation

### MONITOR Module (Setup Monitoring)
- Installation progress tracking
- Dependency status monitoring
- Environment health monitoring
- Resource allocation tracking

## Integration with Marketplace

AgentForge integrates with the InferLoop Marketplace (AgentHub) to:
- Discover and import framework templates
- Publish reusable boilerplates
- Access community-contributed setups
- Benchmark frameworks against industry standards

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install AgentForge CLI
pip install inferloop-agentforge

# Initialize new agent project
agentforge init my-agent --framework langchain

# Setup development environment
agentforge setup --env development

# Generate boilerplate code
agentforge generate --template rag-agent

# Benchmark available frameworks
agentforge benchmark --use-case "data-analysis"
```

## Development Status

**Current Phase**: Design and Architecture

AgentForge is currently in the design phase. The architecture has been defined to provide:
- Multi-framework support (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel, etc.)
- Automated environment provisioning
- Intelligent dependency resolution
- Framework performance benchmarking

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **CLI Framework**: Click/Typer
- **Container Support**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Package Management**: Poetry, pip, conda
- **Configuration**: YAML, TOML, environment files
